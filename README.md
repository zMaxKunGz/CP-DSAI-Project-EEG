# Work Log
<b> [Week 2 : 18-22 Oct 2021]</b> <br>
In this week we discuss about the dataset to choose. For this project we use Brain Invaders calibration-less P300-based BCI with modulation of flash duration Dataset (bi2015a) as our dataset for testing.<br> 
<a>https://zenodo.org/record/3266930#.YW_noxrP2Uk</a> <br>
After we have selected the dataset, we try to understand the experiment behind the dataset and try read all document that the dataset owner provide.<br>
We also need to setup our environment for this testing for each person in our group. Also, try to load the dataset and import to python code.<br>

<b> [Week 1 : 11-15 Oct 2021] </b> <br> 
In this week we mostly disscuss about the datasets we are going to work with and try to understand basic BCI. <br> 
The categery our group choose to work with is Event Related Potentials datasets. Our group choose to study more about the dataset target vs non target. <br>
Focus on the BCI experiment about playing Brain Invaders games. <br> <br>

<b>Pasit:</b> Read About BCI (40%), understanding sustained attention driving dataset paper and about the experiment setup,<br> 
<b>Saratoon:</b> Read About BCI papers (50%), Read the overview of Face houses discrimination Paper and their dataset.<br> 
<b>Nopphawan:</b> Read a BCIs paper (40%), try to understand overview of BCIs and find and read some interesting papers: Brain Invaders, and ERP <br> 
<b>Nuttun:</b> Read about BCI paper in classroom (40%), Read and try to understand concept papers related about "Building Brain Invaders"<br>
